# DiseasepredictionwithMLandflask

It is disease prediction web application built using #flask.

The disease predictions that are done are diabetes prediction and cardiovascular disease prediction.

The model.py and model1.py are the two models trained using two datasets got from kaggle.

model.py is the model for diabetes prediction.

model1.py is the model for cardiovascular disease prediction.

Thee datasets got are preprocessed and are trained with various algorithms and the model with high F1 score are considered.

The jupyter notebooks for both diseases are present in this repository.

The Procfile that is present here can be used to deploy the app in heroku cloud.
